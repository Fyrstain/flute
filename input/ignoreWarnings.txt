# warning with ConceptMap
The modifier extension http://hl7.org/fhir/1.0/StructureDefinition/extension-ConceptMap.element.target.equivalence from FHIR version 1.0 is not allowed to be used at this point (allowed = e:ConceptMap.element.target; this element is [[BackboneElement, ConceptMap.group.element.target]; this is a warning since contexts may be renamed between FHIR versions)
