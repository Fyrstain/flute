### The FLUTE project

#### Overview

The goal of the FLUTE project is to advance and scale up data-driven healthcare by developing novel methods for privacy-preserving cross-border utilization of data hubs. The project performs advanced research to push the performance envelope of secure multi-party computation in Federated Learning, including the associated AI models and secure execution environments.

The technical innovations of the project will be integrated in a privacy-enforcing platform that will provide innovators with a provenly secure environment for federated healthcare AI solution development, testing and deployment, including the integration of real world health data from data hubs and the generation and utilization of synthetic data (categorical, numerical and images).

To maximize the impact, adoption and replicability of the results, the project will contribute to the global HL7 FHIR standard development, and create novel guidelines for GDPR-compliant cross-border Federated Learning in healthcare.

To demonstrate the practical use and impact of the results, the project will integrate the FLUTE platform with health data hubs located in three different countries, use their data to develop a novel federated AI toolset for diagnosis of clinically significant prostate cancer, and perform a multi-national clinical validation study of efficacy of the AI toolset. The toolset will help to improve predictions of aggressive prostate cancer while avoiding unnecessary biopsies, thus improving the welfare of patients and significantly reducing the associated costs.

#### Objectives

The FLUTE project aims to facilitate the sharing and reuse of health data among clinical centers. This is intended to advance research on rare cancers and improve patient access to high-quality care. A significant challenge is building a tool to overcome interoperability issues while complying with privacy regulations.
